The research in our group is very broad, and we are interested in all aspects of machine learning. Particular strengths of the group are in Bayesian approaches to modelling and inference in statistical applications. The type of work we do can range from studying fundamental concepts in applied Bayesian statistics, all the way to getting our algorithms to perform competitively against the state-of-the-art in big-data applications. We also work in a broad range of application domains, including neuroscience, bioinformatics, finance, social networks, and physics, just to name a few, and we actively seek to collaborate with other groups within the Department of Engineering, throughout the university as a whole, and with other groups within the UK and around the world.

This Award consists of a no-strings attached donation to support research in the Cambridge Machine Learning Group on this topic.\nAutomating the process of statistical modeling would have a tremendous impact on fields that currently rely on expert statisticians, machine learning researchers, and data scientists. Such expertise in the data sciences is increasingly in demand, especially with the growth in Big Data problems in the sciences and in industry. The Automatic Statistician is a system which explores an open-ended space of possible statistical models to discover a good explanation of the data, and then produces a detailed report with figures and natural-language text. The Cambridge group, including PhD students James Lloyd and David Duvenaud working with Roger Grosse and Joshua Tenenbaum at MIT, has developed an early version of this system which not only automatically produces a 10-15 page report describing patterns discovered in the data, but returns a statistical model with state-of-the-art extrapolation performance evaluated over real time series data sets from various domains. The system is based on reasoning over an open-ended language of nonparametric models using Bayesian inference.\nKevin P. Murphy, Senior Research Scientist at Google says: “In recent years, machine learning has made tremendous progress in developing models that can accurately predict future data. However, there are at still several obstacles in the way of its more widespread use in the data sciences. The first problem is that current ML methods still require considerable human expertise in devising appropriate features and models. The second problem is that the output of current methods, while accurate, is often hard to understand, which makes it hard to trust. The “automatic statistician” project from Cambridge aims to address both problems, by using Bayesian model selection strategies to automatically choose good models/ features, and to interpret the resulting fit in easy-to-understand ways, in terms of human readable, automatically generated reports. This is a very promising direction for ML research, which is likely to find many applications at Google and beyond.”\nThe ultimate aim of the Automatic Statistician is to produce an artificially intelligent (AI) system for statistics and the data sciences.\nVisit the project’s website at http://www.automaticstatistician.com/.\n","date":1391990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1391990400,"objectID":"fc6feec840fea679700d5ab42f10aa5a","permalink":"http://sagmeticinfotech.com/mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/post/google-awards-750000-for-the-automatic-statistician/","publishdate":"2014-02-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/post/google-awards-750000-for-the-automatic-statistician/","section":"post","summary":"The Automatic Statistician, a project led by Zoubin Ghahramani, has won a $750,000 Google Focused Research Award.

To develop truly intelligent systems — statistical models which can automatically discover patterns in data, perform extrapolation, and learn and make decisions without human intervention — we should develop highly expressive models with the appropriate inductive biases. We most need expressive models for large datasets, which typically provide more information for learning structure. We can often exploit the existing inductive biases (assumptions) or structure of a model for scalable inference, without the need for simplifying assumptions. Underlying many popular models in machine learning is a ‘covariance kernel’. The covariance kernel controls the expressive power and inductive biases of such models. Knowing which kernel to use is difficult, and is generally an unresolved problem. Sometimes expert statisticians hand craft kernels for specialized applications. However, most popular kernels can only be used for smoothing and interpolation. Andrew’s thesis introduces new covariance kernels which enable pattern discovery and extrapolation without human intervention — a step towards automating statistics, and solving kernel selection problems. Moreover, Andrew’s work exploits the structure of these kernels so that these models can scale to massive datasets, with no loss in predictive accuracy. The models in his thesis enable new applications and state of the art results in econometrics, geostatistics, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, time series modelling, kernel discovery, acoustic modelling, image inpainting, texture extrapolation, and video analysis.\nAndrew is soon starting a research fellowship in the SAILING machine learning group at Carnegie Mellon University.\nMore information about Andrew’s award can be found here:\nG-Research PhD Prize Information PhD Prize Call for entries ","date":1389744000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1389744000,"objectID":"4679942f8a5e2520e21ee53289fa158f","permalink":"http://sagmeticinfotech.com/mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/post/andrew-gordon-wilson-wins-10000-prize-for-his-phd-dissertation-on-fast-automatic-pattern-discovery/","publishdate":"2014-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/post/andrew-gordon-wilson-wins-10000-prize-for-his-phd-dissertation-on-fast-automatic-pattern-discovery/","section":"post","summary":"Congratulations to Andrew Gordon Wilson for winning the £10,000 G-Research prize for his PhD dissertation, “Covariance Kernels for Fast Automatic Pattern Discovery and Extrapolation with Gaussian Processes”!\nThe models introduced in Andrew’s dissertation follow several high level principles:","tags":null,"title":"Andrew Gordon Wilson wins £10,000 prize for his PhD dissertation on fast automatic pattern discovery","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Carl Rasmussen’s project on getting a unicycle to stand on its own using techniques from Bayesian reinforcement learning is discussed by Acorn founder Herman Hauser in an interview with BBC Business.

The Classic Paper Prize is given to the paper published at ICML 10 years previously which has had the most impact on the field. Semi-supervised learning refers to the problem of combining small amounts of labelled data (i.e. supervised learning) with large amounts of unlabelled data (i.e. unsupervised learning). This 2003 paper, which has now been cited over 1400 times, developed a simple and highly-scalable graph-based method for semi-supervised classification, and related it to harmonic functions, random walks, electric networks, and spectral graph theory. Graph-based semi-supervised learning has now become a standard approach for combining labelled and unlabelled data in many application domains.\nLink to the paper: http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/papers/zgl.pdf Link to the ICML conference: http://icml.cc/2013/ Link to the Machine Learning group website: http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/ ","date":1373846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1373846400,"objectID":"d124ec7de8b89403a61f5808c82dd41f","permalink":"http://sagmeticinfotech.com/mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/post/zoubin-ghahramani-awarded-classic-paper-prize-at-icml-2013/","publishdate":"2013-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/post/zoubin-ghahramani-awarded-classic-paper-prize-at-icml-2013/","section":"post","summary":"The 2013 Classic Paper Prize at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) was won by Zoubin Ghahramani and coauthors Xiaojin Zhu and John Lafferty for their 2003 paper “Semi-Supervised Learning Using Gaussian Fields and Harmonic Functions” .","tags":null,"title":"Zoubin Ghahramani awarded classic paper prize at ICML 2013","type":"post"},{"authors":["admin","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

From the abstract:\n“Most theories of motor cortex have assumed that neural activity represents movement parameters. This view derives from what is known about primary visual cortex, where neural activity represents patterns of light. Yet it is unclear how well the analogy between motor and visual cortex holds. Single-neuron responses in motor cortex are complex, and there is marked disagreement regarding which movement parameters are represented. A better analogy might be with other motor systems, where a common principle is rhythmic neural activity. Here we find that motor cortex responses during reaching contain a brief but strong oscillatory component, something quite unexpected for a non-periodic behaviour. Oscillation amplitude and phase followed naturally from the preparatory state, suggesting a mechanistic role for preparatory neural activity. These results demonstrate an unexpected yet surprisingly simple structure in the population response. This underlying structure explains many of the confusing features of individual neural responses.”\nThe article: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature11129.html\nPress articles: Department; The Atlantic.\nProf. John Cunningham’s website at Washington University in St. Louis: http://cunningham.wustl.edu/\n","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351728000,"objectID":"f7d5027590b39607fbfd1cafb1f89906","permalink":"http://sagmeticinfotech.com/mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/post/john-cunningham-article-published-in-nature/","publishdate":"2012-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/post/john-cunningham-article-published-in-nature/","section":"post","summary":"Prof. John Cunningham’s article “Neural population dynamics during reaching”, work completed while a Post-Doc in the Machine Learning Group, is published in the journal Nature.
